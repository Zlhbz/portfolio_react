                        I am a foreign trained dentist with PhD in Prosthodontics. I wanted to give it a try different
                        fields
                        during the temporary time I have in the US. I am currently a student in Northwestern University
                        BootCamp. I like coding more even though it is getting difficult day by day. I like hiking in the
                        beautiful national parks of the US. My favorites are Yosemite and Glacier National Park.
